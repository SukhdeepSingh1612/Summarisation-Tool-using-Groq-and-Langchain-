The aspirations of the young to live in a prosperous, safe and \\nproud India should be the guiding factor in whatever profession we contribute. \\n \\nEmpower Villages \\nFriends, I recall my visit to Nagaland on 26th October 2002, soon after m y assuming \\noffice as President. It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai  College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been develope d into a \\ncultivable land. The villagers are busy in cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal and \\nmedicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing and above all \\nrunning marketing centers. It provides a sustainable economic development model for the \\nwhole region. \\n \\nDuring the last eight months, people of Periyar PURA villages technologically supported \\nby Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have w orked with experts \\nfrom Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, for  which core \\ncompetence and raw material are available in Thanjavur district. They developed \\ninternationally competitive prototypes for 55 life style products wi th support of JETRO \\nspecialists and feedback from exhibitions at Delhi and Tokyo. This co -operative venture \\nhas enhanced the innovative ability of the people of all the 65 villages  enabling them to \\ndevelop and produce internationally acceptable products. I have seen si milar type of \\nPURA being established in many states. The whole country needs 7000 PU RA to \\nbridging the rural – urban divide. \\n \\nSeed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth'),\n",

Recently, during my address to the agricultural \\nscientists while participating in a National Symposium on “Agri culture Cannot Wait”, I \\nsummarized the many practical suggestions given by farmers. W e have to double the \\nagricultural production with reduced land, reduced water resources and re duced \\nmanpower and improve the economic conditions of the nation through the principle  of \\n“Seed to Food” since agriculture is the backbone of the nation.

His radiant face was revealing his happy state of mi nd. He introduced himself \\nas Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy. I greeted him and asked him  how this had \\nhappened. He smilingly said that it was from by birth. He thanked G od, his parents, \\nteachers and many others for giving him confidence, training and he lp. I asked him, what \\nI could do for him? He said, “I don’t need anything from you. I would like to sing in fr ont \\nof you”. I readily agreed. He sang melodiously the Saint Thyagraj a’s pancha ratna kriti \\nentharo mahanubavulu in Sriragam giving me a glimpse of his talent. I was quite touched. \\nWhat is the message? Despite being physically challenged, the latent talent of music \\ncould blossom in this \\nperson with his positive attitude and perseverance, encouraged by the pa rents, teachers, \\nacademics and rasikas. Now he wants to give, give and give his art to inspire others. Of \\ncourse, by his merit of music, in July 2007, he performed in the Rashtra pati Bhavan art \\ntheatre. \\n \\nOvercome the impact of disaster through partnership \\nI had the opportunity to experience the Indomitable Spirit of the people  and children of \\nJammu & Kashmir even as they were just recovering from the de vastating earthquake in \\n2005. I visited Urusa village on 26th November 2005 which has been adopted by the  \\nWestern Air Command, Air Force for providing relief and medical aid to the residents of \\nthat area. When I went there, I found that the school building had been severely damaged. \\nI met all the school children and the village citizen of Urusa. The villagers apprised me of \\ntheir losses and had all praise for Army and Air Force role in rescue and relief operations \\nalong with state government.

In these three experiences, I personal ly felt proud of our \\never vigilant Soldiers, Sailors and Air Warriors performing their  tasks beyond the call of \\ntheir duty even in the most adverse circumstances natural and man m ade. During the last \\nfive years, I had an opportunity to present colours to many regime nts, participate in \\nnumber of passing out parades, meet the troops who were going to undertake  peace \\nmissions and interact with the family members of our Defence F orces. Our Defence \\nForces are in a beautiful mission. When the nation sleeps during night , Members of our \\nDefence teams are awake to guard us and remain vigilant to counte r any threat. The \\nNation cherishes the valour, commitment and devotion to duty of our Defenc e Forces. \\nSimilarly, I had opportunities to interact \\nwith members of our para-military forces, central and state poli ce personnel including \\ninternal security forces who are making immense contribution in au gmenting the safety \\nand security of our citizens under difficult conditions. \\n \\nYouth movement for Developed India 2020 \\nRecently, in Hyderabad, I met a group of citizens who are putting i nto practice the motto \\nof transforming of our youth into enlightened citizen.

As per the district authorities the impact of the  training on the students is \\nvisible in terms of self-discipline, love for their parents and tea chers shedding of stage \\nfear and recognition of their duties towards the nation. I talke d to Ms. Padma, a student \\nleader from Andhra Pradesh Tribal Welfare School, Nalgonda who relat ed how she \\nweaned her father away from smoking after imbibing the spirit of  the 10 point oath from \\nthe Lead India Training Camp. This gives me an assurance that the  youth of our country \\nare on the right path \\nthrough this mission oriented programme. With the ignited minds of the  540 million \\nyouth below the age of 25, which I consider is the most powerful resour ce on the earth, \\nunder the earth and above the earth, we have to empower the youth through va lue based \\neducation and leadership. \\n \\nConclusion \\nI was touched by the variety of Indian panorama, emotional content of  the tune, cultural \\ndiversity and unity of minds in the vast land of ours.

Today, it is indeed a thanks giving occasion. I would like to narr ate, how I \\nenjoyed every minute of my tenure enriched by the wonderful assoc iation from each one \\nof you, hailing from different walks of life, be it politics, sci ence and technology, \\nacademics, arts, literature, business, judiciary, administration, local bodies, farming, \\nhome makers, special children, media and above all from the youth and st udent \\ncommunity who are the future wealth of our country. During my intera ction at \\nRashtrapati Bhavan in Delhi and at every state and union territor y as well as through my \\nonline interactions, I have many unique experiences to share with you, which signify the \\nfollowing important messages: \\n \\n1. Accelerate development : Aspiration of the youth, \\n \\n2. Empower villages, \\n \\n3. Mobilize rural core competence for competitiveness, \\n \\n4. Seed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth \\n \\n5. Defeat problems and succeed, \\n \\n6. Overcome problems through partnership, \\n \\n7. Courage in combating calamities, \\n \\n8.

This question reflects how the desire t o live in developed \\nIndia has entered into the minds of the youth. The same feelings are  echoed by over \\nfifteen lakh youth, whom I have met so far and who represent the drea m of the 540 \\nmillion youth of the nation. The aspirations of the young to live in a prosperous, safe and \\nproud India should be the guiding factor in whatever profession we contribute. \\n \\nEmpower Villages \\nFriends, I recall my visit to Nagaland on 26th October 2002, soon after m y assuming \\noffice as President. It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai  College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been develope d into a \\ncultivable land. The villagers are busy in cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal and \\nmedicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing and above all \\nrunning marketing centers. It provides a sustainable economic development model for the \\nwhole region. \\n \\nDuring the last eight months, people of Periyar PURA villages technologically supported \\nby Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have w orked with experts \\nfrom Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, for  which core \\ncompetence and raw material are available in Thanjavur district. They developed \\ninternationally competitive prototypes for 55 life style products wi th support of JETRO \\nspecialists and feedback from exhibitions at Delhi and Tokyo. This co -operative venture \\nhas enhanced the innovative ability of the people of all the 65 villages  enabling them to \\ndevelop and produce internationally acceptable products. I have seen si milar type of \\nPURA being established in many states. The whole country needs 7000 PU RA to \\nbridging the rural – urban divide. \\n \\nSeed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth'),\n",

Recently, during my address to the agricultural \\nscientists while participating in a National Symposium on “Agri culture Cannot Wait”, I \\nsummarized the many practical suggestions given by farmers. W e have to double the \\nagricultural production with reduced land, reduced water resources and re duced \\nmanpower and improve the economic conditions of the nation through the principle  of \\n“Seed to Food” since agriculture is the backbone of the nation. We should em power the \\nfarmers to protect and nurture the fertile land for second green re volution.

His radiant face was revealing his happy state of mi nd. He introduced himself \\nas Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy. I greeted him and asked him  how this had \\nhappened. He smilingly said that it was from by birth. He thanked G od, his parents, \\nteachers and many others for giving him confidence, training and he lp. I asked him, what \\nI could do for him? He said, “I don’t need anything from you. I would like to sing in fr ont \\nof you”. I readily agreed. He sang melodiously the Saint Thyagraj a’s pancha ratna kriti \\nentharo mahanubavulu in Sriragam giving me a glimpse of his talent. I was quite touched. \\nWhat is the message? Despite being physically challenged, the latent talent of music \\ncould blossom in this \\nperson with his positive attitude and perseverance, encouraged by the pa rents, teachers, \\nacademics and rasikas. Now he wants to give, give and give his art to inspire others. Of \\ncourse, by his merit of music, in July 2007, he performed in the Rashtra pati Bhavan art \\ntheatre. \\n \\nOvercome the impact of disaster through partnership \\nI had the opportunity to experience the Indomitable Spirit of the people  and children of \\nJammu & Kashmir even as they were just recovering from the de vastating earthquake in \\n2005. I visited Urusa village on 26th November 2005 which has been adopted by the  \\nWestern Air Command, Air Force for providing relief and medical aid to the residents of \\nthat area. When I went there, I found that the school building had been severely damaged. \\nI met all the school children and the village citizen of Urusa. The villagers apprised me of \\ntheir losses and had all praise for Army and Air Force role in rescue and relief operations \\nalong with state government.

However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai  College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs.

      "\n",
      "1. Accelerate development by fulfilling the aspirations of the youth.\n",
      "2. Empower villages.\n",
      "3. Mobilize rural core competence for competitiveness.\n",
      "4. Focus on agricultural growth by harnessing the \"seed-to-food\" chain.\n",
      "5. Overcome problems and succeed through determination.\n",
      "6. Partner with others to overcome challenges.\n",
      "7. Show courage in the face of calamities.\n",
      "8. Use connectivity to bring about societal transformation.\n",
      "9. Defend the nation with pride.\n",
      "10. Foster a youth movement to achieve a Developed India by 2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "He shares a personal anecdote about a young girl named Anukriti who asked him why India cannot become a developed nation by 2020. He assures her that it is a thoughtful question and expresses his confidence that India can achieve this goal.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker appreciated the question and considered it thoughtful, assuring the person that their dream would be taken to the highest institution of the nation and would be worked on.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech highlights the importance of empowering villages and the aspirations of Indian youth to live in a prosperous, safe, and proud India. The speaker shares their experience visiting a village in Nagaland where they saw an empowered village council functioning with financial powers, taking decisions, and producing fruits and vegetables. They emphasize the need for providing physical connectivity through quality roads to enable faster movement of products from villages to markets.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech also mentions an initiative by Periyar Maniammai College of Technology for Women, which provides urban amenities in rural areas (PURA) to 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This includes physical, electronic, and knowledge connectivity, leading to economic connectivity. The initiative has resulted in the creation of healthcare centers, primary to postgraduate level education, and vocational training centers, leading to large-scale employment generation and creation of entrepreneurs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech highlights the success of the Periyar PURA (Providing Urban Amenities to Rural Areas) project in Thanjavur district. The project has:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Developed 200 acres of wasteland into cultivable land, allowing villagers to cultivate Jatropha, herbal, and medicinal plants, and generate power using biomass.\n",
      "* Established marketing centers, enabling villagers to sell their products.\n",
      "* Provided training and support for 65 villages to develop 55 lifestyle products, making them internationally competitive.\n",
      "* Enhanced the innovative abilities of the villagers, enabling them to produce internationally acceptable products.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker emphasizes that the PURA model has the potential to bridge the rural-urban divide and that the whole country needs around 7000 such projects to achieve this goal.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker shares two enriching experiences. Firstly, they met over 6,000 farmers from different parts of the country at Rashtrapati Bhavan, where the farmers showed interest in various gardens and interacted with horticultural specialists. The speaker emphasized the importance of doubling agricultural production with reduced resources and improving the economic conditions of the nation through the \"Seed to Food\" principle. They expressed confidence that the nation can increase agricultural GDP growth by at least 4% per annum through the partnership of farmers, scientists, and industries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, the speaker recounts a beautiful experience they had with Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy, a person who was born without hands and legs. Despite his physical limitations, he was smiling and happy, and expressed gratitude to God and others for giving him confidence and help. When asked what they could do for him, he replied that he would like to sing in front of them. The speaker is inspired by Vidwan's positivity and resilience in the face of adversity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech is about the power of human spirit and resilience in the face of adversity. The speaker shares two inspiring stories:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. A person with physical disabilities, despite being told he didn't need anything from others, asked to sing in front of the speaker. He sang beautifully, showcasing his hidden talent. This story highlights the importance of perseverance, positive attitude, and encouragement in unlocking one's potential.\n",
      "2. The speech also shares the story of the people of Urusa village in Jammu & Kashmir, who were recovering from a devastating earthquake in 2005. Despite the destruction and loss, the villagers, with the help of the Army, Air Force, and state government, came together to rebuild and overcome the disaster. The speaker praises the villagers' courage and resilience in defeating their problems rather than letting them defeat them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The overall message is that even in the face of adversity, human beings have the capacity to overcome challenges and achieve greatness through partnership, perseverance, and a positive attitude.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker is reflecting on their experiences in the aftermath of natural disasters, such as earthquakes and tsunamis. They describe visiting a village where children and members of the community had bravely participated in relief efforts alongside the Armed Forces, and were even smiling despite the challenges they faced. The speaker also mentions an on-the-spot settlement of relief grants provided to victims whose houses were damaged in the earthquake.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker then shares a personal anecdote from a visit to the Car Nicobar Islands in 2005, where they met with the Tribal Council Leaders, Students, and Children of Chuckchucha village. Despite the loss of life and property due to the 2004 tsunami, the islanders had shown remarkable courage and compassion, taking in affected victims as their own and refusing to refer to them as orphans. The speaker was moved to compose a poem, \"Sea Waves\", which captures the islanders' courage and resilience.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, the speaker mentions addressing the Pan African Parliament in Johannesburg, South Africa, where they emphasized the importance of connectivity for societal transformation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker proposed the concept of a Pan African e-Network, a project to connect 53 African countries with a seamless and integrated network of satellite, fiber optics, and wireless connections, estimated to cost $100 million. The project will connect 12 universities, 17 hospitals, 53 tele-medicine centers, and 53 tele-education centers across Africa. A pilot project in Ethiopia has already been commissioned, including a tele-education program with Ethiopian students and a tele-medicine program with specialists from India.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech discusses various initiatives and achievements of the Indian government and its people. The speaker highlights the success of a tele-consultation project between Hyderabad and Addis Ababa, which has enabled doctors to provide instant medical advice to patients in Africa.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker also expresses pride in the bravery and dedication of India's soldiers, sailors, and air warriors, who perform their duties beyond the call of duty, even in challenging circumstances. The speaker acknowledges the contributions of India's defense forces, para-military forces, and police personnel in ensuring the safety and security of citizens.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, the speech mentions the \"Youth movement for Developed India 2020\" initiative, which aims to transform youth into enlightened citizens and leaders. The speaker met with a group of citizens in Hyderabad who are actively working towards this goal.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker is discussing the Lead India 2020 Foundation, a program that aims to transform young people into enlightened citizens. The program, founded by Dr. N.B. Sudershan, has been successful in training thousands of students in Andhra Pradesh, particularly in the Medak district. The speaker highlights the positive impact the program has had on the students, including increased self-discipline, love for their parents and teachers, and a sense of duty towards the nation. The speaker also shares a personal anecdote about a student leader who used the program's 10-point oath to encourage her father to quit smoking. The speaker believes that empowering the youth through value-based education and leadership is crucial for the country's development. The speech concludes by highlighting the diversity and richness of Indian culture and tradition, and the speaker's confidence in the country's future due to the efforts of organizations like the Lead India 2020 Foundation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is a summary of the speech:\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker emphasizes the importance of preserving India's rich cultural heritage and civilization for future generations. They highlight the country's progress in the last 60 years, the hard work of its people, and the confidence of every sector that India can become a developed nation by 2020. The speaker encourages the youth to aim high and strive to empower others to make a positive impact on the nation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker then outlines a distinctive profile for a developed India 2020, with five key goals:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Reduced rural-urban divide\n",
      "2. Equitable distribution and access to energy and water\n",
      "3. Harmony between agriculture, industry, and service sectors\n",
      "4. Education with a value system accessible to all, regardless of societal or economic discrimination\n",
      "5. India as a destination for talented scholars, scientists, and investors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the speech is an inspiring call to action to work towards a brighter future for India.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech describes a vision of a utopian society where:\n",
      "\n",
      "* All citizens have access to excellent healthcare\n",
      "* Governance is responsive, transparent, and corruption-free\n",
      "* Poverty, illiteracy, and crimes against women and children are eradicated\n",
      "* Everyone feels included and no one is alienated\n",
      "* The nation is prosperous, healthy, secure, peaceful, and happy, with a sustainable growth path.\n",
      "\n",
      "President Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam's speech expresses his gratitude to the citizens of India for their love and support over the past five years. He mentions that India is one of the best places to live and is proud of its leadership. He shares his mission in life, which is to bring people together and instill self-confidence in the nation, with the goal of making India a developed nation by 2020.
